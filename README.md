# NAO-Weather-API
Python boxes for my NAO Weather API project. 

This project calls for a json API responce from openweathermap.org, 
then translates and exports a simple script containing weather data to the next box in the program.

Note that I downloaded the requests library to my computer, then moved the library into the same folder as the nao program. 
You will have to download and type in your own path, and also name the city.
